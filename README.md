# elementary Thunderbird

A theme for Thunderbird 17 that integrates with
[elementary's](http://elementaryos.org) GTK theme.

  * **Installation**:

    or follow the instructions below to get the latest development version
  * **License**: [GNU GPL v2.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0)

This theme uses whatever native icons you've got enabled, so for best results
use [elementary Icons](https://launchpad.net/elementaryicons). The target
platform is of course Linux, but if you *really* want to try it on others just
modify the `install.rdf` file (who knows, maybe it'll work).
